I developed a set of recommendations that address the traffic and pedestrian safety issues in the area surrounding LaGuardia Community College. To create the graphic I imported DoITT planimetric street geometries into AutoCAD before drawing all of the missing elements and road markings, which I measured and recorded in a survey of the area.
