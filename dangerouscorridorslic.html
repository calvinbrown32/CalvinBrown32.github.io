<p>
In this project I used NYC Vision Zero data and ArcGIS to map pedestrian and cyclist injuries and deaths throughout the city. I am confident in working with large datasets to tell compelling stories and answer complex questions. I am also capable of developing spatial decision support systems to help prioritize projects based on a set of weighted criteria.
