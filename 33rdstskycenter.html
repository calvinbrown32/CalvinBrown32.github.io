<strong>Sketchup, Photoshop, Illustrator</strong>
<p>
Responding to a number of issues in the area surrounding the 33rd St. - Rawson St. 7 line stop, including long pedestrian wait times, dangerous crossing conditions at Queens Blvd, a lack of green space (which comprises less than .2% of the total area), and a lack of commercial amenities, I envisioned a public-private transit-oriented development that mitigates all of these problems. I built the model of the structure and matched it to the photo using Sketchup. I then used photoshop to add greater detail to the model and scene.
