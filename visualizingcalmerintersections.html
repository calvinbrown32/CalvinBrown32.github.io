Over thirty pedestrians and cyclists have been injured in crashes at this complex juncture since January 2013. In this project I envisioned small, pragmatic adjustments and calming measures to mitigate the severe safety issues and pedestrian unfriendliness of the intersection. I referenced NACTO design guides and was careful to ensure that the number of travel lanes was not reduced. To make the graphics I exported DoITT planimetric road geometries to CAD and drafted missing pedestrian islands and road markings using measurements that I took on-site.</p>
