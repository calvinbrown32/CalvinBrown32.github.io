<p>This interactive chart will be part of a dashboard that provides quick access to transportation mode share, demographics, and income data for commuters traveling into Manhattan's Central Business District (CBD). The dashboard will offer easy access to important data and facts in the congestion pricing debate. The interactive chart, for example, refutes claims that the congestion charge would be a regressive tax by showing that workers who drive have a significantly higher mean income than those taking transit.
