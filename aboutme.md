title: About me
---
I am an urban planner with a broad set of interests and skills. I entered the world of urban planning as a Bicycling Ambassador for the City of Chicago with the desire to make city streets safer for cycling. The position was formative, exposing me to the expanse of players, policies, and city agencies involved in the decision making processes that shape our urban landscape. I worked directly with elected officials and city planners, and formed lasting relationships with activists and planners that inspired me to earn a master's in urban planning from Hunter College.
