<p>The main goals of this project were as follows: 1. To educate my colleagues on the power of Python in producing well-documented, reproducible analyses and automation tools, 2. To test Jupyter Binder as a platform for sharing Python based automation and analysis tools, and 3. To create an easy-to-use, interactive Python tool that doesn't necessitate installation of software or the configuration of a complex environment, and can be shared anywhere in the world and across platforms.</p>

<p>The Python script that I wrote automates the download, cleaning, and mapping of census data. </p>

<p>The following link will open the Jupyter Binder (note:The loading process can take a minute or two, so please be patient) </p>
