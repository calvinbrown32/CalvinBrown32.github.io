<div class = "col-sm-12">
<p> I created a Jupyter Binder/Notebook that uses Python to automate the downloading, processing, and visual communication of Census data. The Notebook walks users through the process of downloading census data via the Census Data API, munging the data to calculate bicycle mode share by census tract, and joining the data to census tract geographic data for mapping. Finally, the script uses Folium to create an interactive Leaflet map that displays the bicycle commute to work mode share for each census tract.

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li> Educate colleagues on the power of using Python to develop well-documented, reproducible analyses and automation tools.</li>
<li> Test Jupyter Binder as cloud computing solution for sharing Python based automation and analysis tools that can be shared worldwide.</li>
<li> Create an easy-to-use, interactive and standalone Python tool that doesn't necessitate additional software or the configuration of a complex python environment.</li>
<li> Foster cross-discipline collaboration by making the Python development process more transparent and accessible. </li>
<li> Automate the downloading, processing, and visual communication of Census data.</li>
</ul>
